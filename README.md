# udemy-cpp20-masterclass-project-template
My own customized project template based on the one used in [The C++20 Masterclass : From Fundamentals to Advanced by Daniel Gakwaya on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/1051tA3@dgvDnigLPrMR136kwUQgG8KJpjnsxpsIgp5FEl70gWi7bwZCqTnjFd-aFD_jIV-L9A==/). Inteded to target Windows and Linux environments.

## Tailored for these tools:

### Editor:
* Visual Studio Code

### Compiler (Windows):
* GCC/G++
* Clang/LLVM
* MSVC

### Compiler (Linux):
* GCC/G++
* Clang/LLVM

### Debugger:
* GDB
* LLDB

---

## Note:
* This project uses C++20.
* It assumes the development environment is correctly set up in advance. I.e. all compilers and debuggers are accessible via `$PATH`, and VS Code is installed with the C/C++ extention. Refer to the course for more info. If you don't have access to the Udemy course, here is the free version of that course also by the same instructor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLOx1hD3_o.
* Does not use Make or Cmake. The point is to manually practice building in both Windows and Linux environments.
